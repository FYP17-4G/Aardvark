FYP17_4G Krypto For Android
====

Objectives
----
The purpose of this project is to create an Android equivalent of the Krypto.exe tools provided by Professor Willy Susilo.

We will be improving the program by introducing a "Tutorial" section on top of the required functionality. Hopefully, this will be sufficient to educate users on the methods used to encrypt and decrypt messages. ( ~~~Maybe Rephrase~~~~ )
