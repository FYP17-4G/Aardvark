Okay then, that’s what I’ll do. I will tell you a story. Can you hear them?
All those people who lived in terror of you and your judgement, all those people whose ancestors devoted themselves,
sacrificed themselves, to you… Can you hear them singing? Well you like to think you’re a god.
Well you’re not a god, you’re just a parasite eaten out with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others.
You feed on them, on the memories of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow.
So…So come on then, take my memories. But I hope you’ve got a big appetite because I have lived a long life,
and I have seen a few things. I walked away from the last great Time War, I marked the passing of the time lords.
I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out, moment by moment until nothing remained…
No time, no space, just me! I walked in universe where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a mad man.
And I’ve watched universes freeze and creations burn. I have seen things you wouldn’t believe and I have lost things
you will never understand! And I know things… Secrets that must never be told, knowledge that must never be spoken,
knowledge that would make parasite gods blaze. So come on then. Take it! Take it all baby! Have it! You have it all!
