# The front page works as intended. Need polishing
# onTouch listener works as intended, bg colour changed on click
# Display test feedback message (Snackbar) works, and System.out.println as well, just don't forget to delete these lines (see TODO list)
# Each recycler element is assigned a unique ID and title, use this as composite key later to fetch relevant data

# Work out how to add new project directory on (+) icon click (see TODO list)
# Do the individual project view activity, display relevant title and id in the page, just hardcode the rest
# Figure out how to use the navigation menu
