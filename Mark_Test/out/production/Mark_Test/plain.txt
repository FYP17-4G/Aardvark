Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy;
he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!
My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? Your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar?
