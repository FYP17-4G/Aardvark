[Android Application Change Notes]

<20 December 2017>
+ Added some empty functions for Crypto functions:
	(hint: look for keyword "TODO(***)")
	- Transposition functions
	- Substitution functions
	- Shift functions
	- Cipher Frequency calculation functions
+ Refractored source files for easier naming conventions
+ Added folder "KryptoTools" for Krypto related .java files

<21 December 2017>
+ [GUI]Added Graph interface
	- Downloaded GraphView library online
	link: http://www.android-graphview.org/download-getting-started/
	setup instruction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbTvJZX0UDk
	- The graph displays 2 lines, one for cipher text, one for cipher text of period N

+ [GUI]Changed "Spinner" widget for Shift cipher to "Seek bar" widget
+ Added interface to set IC period:

<22 December 2017>
+[GUI]Added basic error handling in MainActivity.java
+[GUI]Added rename function for each project entry (Long press project entry)
+[GUI]Added Copy to clipboard and Paste from clipboard buttons for Encryption/Decryption feature, as a mean to get text input and cipher text result
+[GUI]Added interface and empty functions for Encryption/Decryption feature
	(hint: look for keyword "TODO(&&&)")
	- Rectangular Transposition (Encryption only)
	- Rectangular Substitution (Encryption only)
	- Shift Cipher (Encryption and decryption)
	- Vigenere Inverse (Encryption only)
	- Vigenere Subtractive (Encryption only)
	- Vigenere Additive (Encryption only)

<23 December 2017>
+[GUI] real-time update of cipher text with certain period applied on graph now works
+ Some bug fixing

<24 December 2017>
#Bug report:
- Project rename prompt appears on pressing back from project View (if the button from bottom navigation panel is pressed)
- Index out of bounds exception in substitution by string function (rect key subst)

+ Integrates all Crypto functions to the GUI to find more possible bugs
+ Slightly modified some Krypto codes for compatibility: (below are modified functions)
	- Shift Cipher

+ [GUI]Added Encryption and Decryption GUI for the Encryption/Decryption feature
	- Shift Cipher
	- All Vigenere Cipher
	- Rectangular Transposition
+ Copy and paste functions for Encryption / Decryption feature works properly

##TODO NEXT
- GUI for permutation
- merge Columnar transposition in project view
- fix rectangular substitution (this affects "substitution by string" and rect transposition(in encrypt decrypt feature))

<26 December 2017>
- [GUI] added tabbed menu for projectView
- Permutation works (But still needs more tuning => still laggy & still need to figure out how to display each permutation separately)
- Slightly changed permutation.java code to fit into the application (will be re-adjusted by the original author later)
- Displaying characters per space and words per line works
- IC result is now sorted

- fixed a bug in IC calculation
- fixed stupid error in the frequency graph


<14 January 2018>
- Persistent session works properly
- Rearranged elements in project view to make it tidier
- New GUI for when creating a new project works
	- User can now enter the cipher text by themselves or get it from a file
- minor bug fixes

<16 January 2018>
- Bug fix(Inconsistent shift cipher value when sliding the seek bar too fast)
- UI redesign (Color scheme)

<17 January 2018>
- UI redesign (Frequency analysis), it is now fancier
- Some code refractoring and importing Mark's code into the android app

<18 January 2018>
- Modified some Mark's code to return value needed for my code
- Added common word occurrences into the interface
- Frequency analysis is now sorted.
- Fixed a bug (Data lost when renaming project)
