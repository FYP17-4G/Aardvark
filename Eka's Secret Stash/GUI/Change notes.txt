[Android Application Change Notes]

<<ITERATION 1>>

<20 December 2017>
+ Added some empty functions for Crypto functions:
	(hint: look for keyword "TODO(***)")
	- Transposition functions
	- Substitution functions
	- Shift functions
	- Cipher Frequency calculation functions
+ Refactored source files for easier naming conventions
+ Added folder "KryptoTools" for Krypto related .java files

<21 December 2017>
+ [GUI]Added Graph interface
	- Downloaded GraphView library online
	link: http://www.android-graphview.org/download-getting-started/
	setup instruction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbTvJZX0UDk
	- The graph displays 2 lines, one for cipher text, one for cipher text of period N

+ [GUI]Changed "Spinner" widget for Shift cipher to "Seek bar" widget
+ Added interface to set IC period:

<22 December 2017>
+[GUI]Added basic error handling in MainActivity.java
+[GUI]Added rename function for each project entry (Long press project entry)
+[GUI]Added Copy to clipboard and Paste from clipboard buttons for Encryption/Decryption feature, as a mean to get text input and cipher text result
+[GUI]Added interface and empty functions for Encryption/Decryption feature
	(hint: look for keyword "TODO(&&&)")
	- Rectangular Transposition (Encryption only)
	- Rectangular Substitution (Encryption only)
	- Shift Cipher (Encryption and decryption)
	- Vigenère Inverse (Encryption only)
	- Vigenère Subtractive (Encryption only)
	- Vigenère Additive (Encryption only)

<23 December 2017>
+[GUI] real-time update of cipher text with certain period applied on graph now works
+ Some bug fixing

<24 December 2017>
#Bug report:
- Project rename prompt appears on pressing back from project View (if the button from bottom navigation panel is pressed)
- Index out of bounds exception in substitution by string function (rect key subst)

+ Integrates all Crypto functions to the GUI to find more possible bugs
+ Slightly modified some Krypto codes for compatibility: (below are modified functions)
	- Shift Cipher

+ [GUI]Added Encryption and Decryption GUI for the Encryption/Decryption feature
	- Shift Cipher
	- All Vigenère Cipher
	- Rectangular Transposition
+ Copy and paste functions for Encryption / Decryption feature works properly

<26 December 2017>
- [GUI] added tabbed menu for projectView
- Permutation works (But still needs more tuning => still laggy & still need to figure out how to display each permutation separately)
- Slightly changed permutation.java code to fit into the application (will be re-adjusted by the original author later)
- Displaying characters per space and words per line works
- IC result is now sorted

- fixed a bug in IC calculation
- fixed stupid error in the frequency graph


<<ITERATION 2>>

<14 January 2018>
# Bug report: 
- Inconsistent shift value when sliding too quickly
- Cannot rename project

+ Persistent session works properly
+ Rearranged elements in project view to make it tidier
+ New GUI for when creating a new project works
	- User can now enter the cipher text by themselves or get it from a file
+ minor bug fixes

<16 January 2018>
#Bug report:
- Missing title and cipher text in project view when reopening the app

+ fix Inconsistent shift cipher value when sliding the seek bar too fast bug (reported @ 14 January 2018)
+ UI redesign (Color scheme)

<17 January 2018>
#Bug report:
- NumberFormatException error in IC calculation

+ UI redesign (Frequency analysis), it is now fancier
+ Some code refactoring and importing Mark's code into the android app

<18 January 2018>
+ Modified some Mark's code to return value needed for my code
+ Added common word occurrences into the interface
+ Frequency analysis is now sorted.
+ Fixed Data lost when renaming project bug (reported @ 14 January 2018)

<19 January 2018>
+ Added 'note' function
+ Some UI element redesigning
+ Fixed a bug (Missing cipher text and project title when reopening the application and continue where the user left off; reported @ 16 January 2018)
+ Fixed NumberFormatException error during IC calculation (reported @ 17 January 2018)

<22 January 2018>
#Bug report: Application crashes when trying to do shift for a value > 0

+ User can now save the crypto project
+ Integrated SQLite into the program
	- SQLite is now fully functional on current version of the app

<24 January 2018>
+ Redesigned the UI (changed the project list container to a card)
+ Redesigned colour scheme (Dominant white, shades of grey, with navy blue accent)
+ Added options for the user to edit the project, and delete the project under the same menu

<25 January 2018>
#Bug report: Long press on Card view sensitivity is too sensitive, find a workaround for this.

+ Search bar added
+ Long pressing on the card will show cipher text preview pop up

<26 January 2018>
#Bug report: 
- Front page action bar CTD error (Action bar already supplied by window service error)
- Vigenere encryption and decryption error in encryption/decryption activity

+ User can now change between light theme and dark theme (Though it works partially)
+ Some code rearrangement (to make the source code look tidier)

<27 January 2018>
#Bug report:
- Changing theme only works on some elements and activities

+ Fixed action bar CTD error bug (reported @26 January 2018)
+ The user can now click on the graph in frequency analysis activity to expand the detailed information of the graph (now with animation!)
+ Animated the search bar, so the user have to be at the top of the list to be able to see the search bar
+ Fixed Vigenere encryption decryption error (reported @ 26 January 2018)

<29 January 2018>
+ Theme changing Fully works
+ Fixed a bug (chars/word and words/line sliders does not correspond to the cipher text (discovered today))
+ Fixed card view long click sensitivity (reported @ 25 January 2018)

/*NEXT UP: 
> Allow user to determine the common word occurrences length
> Add read from file function for encryption and decryption feature
*/
